abstract = {I present and describe a new software package in the R statistical programming environment for dendrochronology. R is considered the world?s pre-eminent open-source statistical computing environment where users can contribute packages, which are freely available on the Internet. The dendrochronology program library in R (dplR) is able to read standard decadal-format files and allows users to perform several standard analyses including interactive detrending, chronology building, and the calculation of standard descriptive statistics. The package can also produce a variety of publication quality plots. The dplR package should make it easier for dendrochronologists to take advantage of R and use it as their primary analytic environment.},

abstract = {I demonstrate new functionality for the Dendrochronology Program Library in R (dplR) that allows for flexible statistical crossdating of tree-ring data. Using a well-dated ring-width file, I give examples of howdplR can be used to examine correlations between each series and a master chronology according to overlapping time periods (segments) specified by the user; examine moving correlations of suspect series; and compute cross-correlation functions to identify specific dating issues. I also show how automatically generated skeleton plots can be used to visually crossdate. Much of the terminology and approach used for crossdating in dplR will be familiar to users of COFECHA.},

@article{Bunn2013,
abstract = {Mean sensitivity ($\zeta$) continues to be used in dendrochronology despite a literature that shows it to be of questionable value in describing the properties of a time series. We simulate first-order autoregressive models with known parameters and show that $\zeta$ is a function of variance and autocorrelation of a time series. We then use 500 random tree-ring data sets with unknown parameters and show that $\zeta$ is at best equivalent to the standard deviation of a time series in cases without high autocorrelation and is an inefficient estimator of the coefficient of variation. It is hard to justify the use of $\zeta$ as a useful, descriptive statistic in dendrochronology on theoretical or empirical grounds. It is better to make a thorough evaluation of the time series properties of a data set and we suggest various avenues for doing so including some that are maybe unfamiliar to most dendrochronologists including generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (GARCH) models.},
