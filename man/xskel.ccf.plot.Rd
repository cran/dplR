\usage{
xskel.ccf.plot(rwl,series,series.yrs = as.numeric(names(series)),
                       win.start, win.width=50, n = NULL, prewhiten = TRUE, 
                       biweight = TRUE)

}
\arguments{
  \item{rwl}{ a \code{data.frame} with series as columns and years as rows
    such as that produced by \code{\link{read.rwl}}. }
  \item{series}{ a \code{numeric} or \code{character} vector.  Usually a
    tree-ring series.  If the length of the value is 1, the
    corresponding column of \code{\var{rwl}} is selected (by name or
    position) as the series and ignored when building the master
    chronology.  Otherwise, the value must be \code{numeric}. }
  \item{series.yrs}{ a \code{numeric} vector giving the years of
    \code{\var{series}}.  Defaults to
    \code{as.numeric(names(\var{series}))}. }
  \item{win.start}{ year to start window }
  \item{win.width}{ an even integral value } 
  \item{n}{ \code{NULL} or an integral value giving the filter length for the
    \code{\link{hanning}} filter used for removal of low frequency
    variation. }
  \item{prewhiten}{ \code{logical} flag. If \code{TRUE} each series is
    whitened using \code{\link{ar}}. }
  \item{biweight}{ \code{logical} flag. If \code{TRUE} then a robust
    mean is calculated using \code{\link{tbrm}}. }

\details{
This function produces a plot that is a mix of a skeleton plot and a 
cross-correlation plot. It's used in crossdating.

The top panel shows the normalized values for the master chronology
(bottom half) and the series (top half) in green. The values are the 
detrended and standardized data (e.g., RWI).

Similarly, the black lines are a skeleton plot for the master and 
series with the marker years annotated for the master on the bottom axis and 
series on the top. The text at the top of the figure gives the
correlation between the series and master (green bars) as well as the percentage 
of agreement betwen the years of skeleton bars for the series and master. 
I.e., if all the black lines occur in the same years the percentage would be
100\%. 

The bottom panels show cross correlations for the first half (left) and second 
half of the time series using function \code{\link{ccf}} as
\code{ccf(x=series,y=master,lag.max=5}. 

The plot is built using the \code{\link[grid]{Grid}} package which allows for
great flexibility in building complicated plots. However, these plots look best
when they don't cover too wide a range of years (unless the plotting device
is wider than is typical). For that reason the user 
will get a warning if \code{win.width} is greater than 100 years.
