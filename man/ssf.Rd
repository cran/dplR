    rows such as that produced by \code{\link{read.rwl}}. See \sQuote{Details}. }

    method.  See \sQuote{Details} below.  Possible values are \cr \code{c("Spline", "AgeDepSpline")}.}

    fitted curve in methods. See \sQuote{Details} in \code{\link{detrend.series}}.}

    about models and data will be added to the return value.  See

\details{
This function creates a simple signal-free chronology that loosely follows the procedures laid out on p75 of Melvin and Briffa (2008). This function is a lighter version of that procedure and users who want more control and refinement should look to the CRUST program decried in Melvin and Briffa (2014). These steps are described in more detail in \href{https://opendendro.github.io/dplR-workshop/}{Learning to Love R}.
  \enumerate{ 
    \item Detrend each series using the selected method, calculate RWI by division (or subtraction), and create an initial mean-value chronology.
    \item Create signal-free measurements by dividing (or subtracting) each series of measurements by the chronology. If \code{return.info} is invoked these are returned in \code{sfRW_Array}.
    \item Rescale the signal-free measurements to their original mean. If \code{return.info} is invoked these are returned in \code{sfRWRescaled_Array}.
    \item If the sample depth is one, replace signal-free measurements with original measurements.
    \item Fit curves to signal free measurements.If \code{return.info} is invoked these are returned in \code{sfRWRescaledCurves_Array}.
    \item Get new growth indicies by dividing (or subtracting) the original measurements by curves in the last step. If \code{return.info} is invoked these are returned in \code{sfRWI_Array}.
    \item Create a mean-value chronology using the indicies from the prior step. If \code{return.info} is invoked these are returned in \code{sfCrn_Mat}.
    \item Repeat steps two through seven up to \code{maxIter} or until the \code{madThreshold} is reached. The stopping criteria is determined using the absolute difference between filtered chronologies generated in interation k and k-1. This is done with the residuals of a high-pass filter on the chronology using a cubic smoothing spline (\code{\link{caps}}) with the stiffness set as the median of the segment lengths of series contributing to the chronology. The stopping threshold is calculated as the median absolute difference of the kth and kth-1 chronologies weighted by the normalized sample depth. If \code{return.info} is invoked the residual chronologies are returned in \code{hfCrnResids_Mat} and the median absolute differences are returns in \code{MAD_Vec}.
}
  
    The input object (\code{rwl}) should be of \code{class} \code{rwl}. If it not, the function will attempt to coerce it using \code{\link{as.rwl}} and a warning will be issued.
  
  See the references below for further details on detrending. It's a dark art.

\value{
    An object of of class \code{crn} and \code{data.frame} with the signal-free chronology and the sample depth. The years are stored as row numbers.
