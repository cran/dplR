\title{Fill Internal NA}
\description{
  This function fills internal \code{NA} values (i.e., those with numeric data
  above and below a small data gap) in each column of a
  \code{data.frame} such as a data set of ring widths as produced by
  \code{\link{read.rwl}}.
}
\usage{
fill.internal.NA(x, fill = c("Mean", "Spline", "Linear"))
}
\arguments{
  \item{x}{a \code{data.frame} of ring widths with
    \code{row.names(\var{x})} containing years and \code{names(\var{x})}
    containing each series \acronym{ID} such as produced by
    \code{\link{read.rwl}}}
  \item{fill}{a \code{numeric} value (e.g., \code{0}) or a \code{character} string of
    \code{"Mean"}, \code{"Spline"}, or \code{"Linear"}. Defaults to \code{"Mean"}.}
}
\details{
  There are occasionally data gaps within a tree-ring series. Some of
  the functions in dplR will fail
  when an internal \code{NA} is encountered (e.g. \code{\link{ffcsaps}}). This
  function fills internal \code{NA} values with either a given numeric value
  (e.g., \code{0}) or through crude imputation. The latter can be calculated as 
  the mean of the series (\code{fill="Mean"}) or calculated by fitting a cubic spline
  (\code{fill="Spline"}) using the \code{\link{spline}} function or calculated
  by linear approximation (\code{fill="Linear"}) using the function
  \code{\link{approx}}.

  Editorial: Having internal \code{NA} in a tree-ring series is
  often bad practice and filling those values should be done with
  caution. For instance, some users code missing rings as \code{NA}
  instead of \code{0}. And missing values (i.e., \code{NA}) are
  sometimes present in maximum latewood density data when the rings are
  small. A common, but not reccomended, practice is to leave stretches
  of \code{NA} values in places where it has been impossible to
  accurately measure rings (perhaps because of a break in the core). It
  is often better to treat that core as two separate series (e.g., "01A"
  and "01B" rather than have internal \code{NA} values. As with all
  processing, the analyst should make a decision based on their
  experience with the wood and not rely on software to make a choice for
  them!
