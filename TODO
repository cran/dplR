o[andybunn]  Recode vignettes into markdown so as to have them on Rpubs?

o[mvkorpel]  Add option for smooth CI curves from theoretical AR1 in redfit!

*  At the moment, in the crossdating functions where a user wants to compare a 
   series to a master chrnology we calculate the master from a rwl object.
   The pick.rwl.series function was a great improvement to the former method
   of having to pass in a rwl and a series argument. One further addition
   will be to add in a crn as either the master (or the series?). I'm not sure
   about the best way to do this as of yet. It might be that changing the name
   of the argument from rwl to just "data" might be the best option and handle
   data differntly based on its class.


*  Calculate the NET index that was proposed by Esper, J., Neuwirth, B. 
   and Treydte, K.S. 2001 A new parameter to evaluate temporal signal 
   strength of tree-ring chronologies. Dendrochronologia, 19 (1), 93-102.

o[andybunn]  xskel.cff.plot is a renamed version of skel.cff.plot which has been taken 
   out of the package. I think. The x preface is to denote its use
   in crossdating. This function needs to have checks built in that will allow
   it to be used on rwl and crn objects (for the master).
-  The relative growth calculation in for this plot has been moved to
   its own function called xskel.calc in helpers.R
_  I will make a version without the ccf plots as well "xskel.plot."

o[mvkorpel]  Finish the verbose option for detrend.series and it's bretheren
   (e.g., detrend, i.detrend.series, i.detrend). Better yet, should we 
   depricate the i.detrend functions and have "interactive" be an argument
   to detrend?

o[mvkorpel] Should we use class('rwl) as a way of error checking? 
   E.g.,when a function has "rwl" as an argument should there be a check:
      if (!inherits(rwl, "rwl")) {
          stop('use only with "rwl" objects')
- Related: We should have functions is.rwl() and as.rwl() 

o[andybunn]  Write more vignettes:
-  Advanced chronology building (strip.rwl, etc.)
